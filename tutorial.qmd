This tutorial demonstrates an example workflow for how to use the `data_fixr` package to clean and analyze your data.

## Installation

First, install the package from Test PyPI:
```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ data-fixr==0.1.2
```

## Getting Started

Import the functions you need:
```{python}
from data_fixr import (
    correlation_report,
    remove_duplicates,
    detect_anomalies,
    missing_values
)
import pandas as pd
```

## Load Sample Data

Let's create a sample dataset to demonstrate the package functionality:
```{python}
# Create sample data with some issues
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'age': [25, 30, 25, 150, 35, 30],  # 150 is an anomaly
    'income': [50000, 60000, 50000, 70000, None, 60000],  # contains duplicate row and missing value
    'years_experience': [3, 7, 3, 25, 10, 7]
})
data
```

## Detecting Missing Values

Check for missing values in the data and fill them in with method: 'mode'
To see alternative method values, navigate to the [reference](https://ubc-mds.github.io/data_fixr/reference/) page.
```{python}
missing_report = missing_values(data)
print(missing_report)
```

As well as filling in the missing values with the specified method, the function also returns a column with the percentage of total DataFrame values that were originally missing and have been filled.

## Removing Duplicates

Identify and remove duplicate rows, keeping the first instance of the duplicated observation:
```{python}
clean_data = remove_duplicates(data, keep='first', report=True)
print(clean_data)
```

As well as removing the duplicated observation, the function also produces a report of the the number of duplicates detected, number of rows removed, strategy used etc. To see full details of the report parameter feature, see the [reference](https://ubc-mds.github.io/data_fixr/reference/) page.

## Detecting Anomalies

Find outliers or anomalous values with default zscore method:
```{python}
anomalies = detect_anomalies(data)
print(anomalies)
```

The result returned is a tuple of a dataframe summarizing which obervations are outliers using boolean (True/False) column, along with an outlier percnetage score across all numeric columns. The function can also use the 'iqr' method for detecting anomalies, see [reference](https://ubc-mds.github.io/data_fixr/reference/) page for more information.

## Correlation Analysis

Generate a correlation report showing pairwise correlations between all numeric variables in the data using the pearson correlation method:
```{python}
corr_report = correlation_report(data, method='spearman')
print(corr_report)
```

Each row in the returned report represents the correlation value for each unique pair of numeric features. An absolute correlation value is also computed. Navigate to the [reference](https://ubc-mds.github.io/data_fixr/reference/) page to explore alternative values for the method parameter.
