title: "Retrospective "
jupyter: python3
---

Here we present a retrospective analysis of the *data_fixr* project, developed as part of **2025–26 DSCI-524 Group 3**.  
The goal of this retrospective is to reflect on our planning accuracy, workflow organization, tooling decisions, and collaboration practices, using evidence collected from GitHub Projects across all four milestones.

---

### Evidence Used

This retrospective is grounded in data from the following GitHub Project views and insights:

- [**Milestone Progress**](https://github.com/orgs/UBC-MDS/projects/310/views/11) (Table view grouped by milestone)
- [**Burn-up / Completion Chart**](https://github.com/orgs/UBC-MDS/projects/310/insights/3) (Insights view grouped by milestone and status)
- [**Team Workload**](https://github.com/orgs/UBC-MDS/projects/310/views/12)(Table view grouped by assignee, filtered to completed tasks)

These views were used to assess scope evolution, bottlenecks, and contribution balance.

### Milestone Progress and Planning Accuracy

Using the **Milestone Progress** view, we observed that workload was the most during Milestone 2.

- **Milestone 1** primarily focused on project setup, writing function documentations, and scaffolding. (Count of Items: 13)
- **Milestone 2** introduced function implementations and unit testing, with a moderate increase in issue count. (Count of Items: 17)
- **Milestone 3** showed a moderate amount of issues related to CI/CD configuration, documentation builds, and deployment previews. (Count of Items: 13)
- **Milestone 4** had fewer issues overall, but required higher coordination and review effort.

**Reflection:**  
Infrastructure-related tasks, particularly CI/CD and documentation deployment, were underestimated during early planning. While core function development proceeded smoothly, automation and deployment required more iterative debugging than anticipated.

---

### Workflow and Bottlenecks

The **Burn-up / Completion Chart** revealed temporary bottlenecks during Milestone 3.

- Several issues accumulated in the *In Progress* and *Review* states while CI/CD workflows were being debugged.

**Reflection:**  
CI/CD setup became the primary bottleneck, delaying dependent tasks. Earlier experimentation with deployment workflows could have reduced friction later in the project. Distribution of Tasks was even in Milestone 3 aswell but that was just the nature of the tasks.

---

### Team Contributions and Bus Factor

The **Team Workload** view showed a generally balanced distribution of completed issues across team members.

- Some contributors had fewer issues assigned but worked on higher-complexity tasks, such as CI/CD workflows and deployment previews.
- Milestone 3 caused disparity in the distribution of tasks which showed some members to have lower amount of tasks than others.
- Other contributors handled multiple smaller issues related to documentation and testing.

**Reflection:**  
While issue counts were not perfectly uniform, the overall workload was balanced when task complexity was considered.

### Retrospective Summary (DAKI)

### Drop
- Using Slack for communication issues rather than Github issues.

### Add
- Earlier CI/CD prototyping during the project timeline.
- Posting documentation preview links directly in pull request comments.
- Clearer pull request templates to standardize reviews.

### Keep
- Issue-based task ownership with clear assignees.
- Writing unit tests alongside function implementations.
- Using GitHub Projects to track progress across milestones.

### Improve
- Milestone scoping to better account for infrastructure and automation complexity.
- Cross-training team members on CI/CD workflows to reduce bus-factor risk.

### Tools, Infrastructure, and Scaling Considerations

Throughout the project, we applied several development tools and practices introduced in this course, including GitHub Actions for testing and deployment, GitHub Projects for task tracking, and structured branching workflows.

If this project were to be scaled up or extended (e.g., as a capstone project), we would:
- Introduce additional CI checks such as linting and formatting enforcement.
- Apply stricter branch protection rules earlier.
- Expand documentation automation and preview tooling.
- Distribute infrastructure knowledge more evenly across the team.

These improvements would enhance maintainability, reliability, and collaboration efficiency as project complexity grows.
