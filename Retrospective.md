# Project Retrospective – data_fixr

This document presents a retrospective analysis of the *data_fixr* project, developed as part of **2025–26 DSCI-524 Group 3**.  
The goal of this retrospective is to reflect on our development process, tooling, collaboration practices, and planning accuracy, using evidence collected from our GitHub Project board across all four milestones.

## Evidence Used

The retrospective is grounded in data from the following GitHub Project views and charts:

- **Milestone Progress** (Table view grouped by milestone)
- **Burn-up / Completion Chart** (Insights view grouped by milestone and status)
- **Team Workload** (Table view grouped by assignee, filtered to completed tasks)

These views were used to assess scope evolution, workload distribution, and workflow bottlenecks.
