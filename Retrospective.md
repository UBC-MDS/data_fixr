# Project Retrospective – data_fixr

This document presents a retrospective analysis of the *data_fixr* project, developed as part of **2025–26 DSCI-524 Group 3**.  
The goal of this retrospective is to reflect on our planning accuracy, workflow organization, tooling decisions, and collaboration practices, using evidence collected from GitHub Projects across all four milestones.

---

## Evidence Used

This retrospective is grounded in data from the following GitHub Project views and insights:

- **Milestone Progress** (Table view grouped by milestone)
- **Burn-up / Completion Chart** (Insights view grouped by milestone and status)
- **Team Workload** (Table view grouped by assignee, filtered to completed tasks)

These views were used to assess scope evolution, bottlenecks, and contribution balance.

## Milestone Progress and Planning Accuracy

Using the **Milestone Progress** view, we observed that workload was the most during Milestone 2.

- **Milestone 1** primarily focused on project setup, writing function documentations, and scaffolding. (Count of Items: 13)
- **Milestone 2** introduced function implementations and unit testing, with a moderate increase in issue count. (Count of Items: 17)
- **Milestone 3** showed a moderate amount of issues related to CI/CD configuration, documentation builds, and deployment previews. (Count of Items: 13)
- **Milestone 4** had fewer issues overall, but required higher coordination and review effort.

**Reflection:**  
Infrastructure-related tasks, particularly CI/CD and documentation deployment, were underestimated during early planning. While core function development proceeded smoothly, automation and deployment required more iterative debugging than anticipated.
